Icon Placeholder

Since we cannot create PNG files directly in code, you have a few options:

**Quick Option - Use Default Icon for Now:**
The flutter_launcher_icons package is installed and configured. When you create your icon:

1. Create a 1024x1024 PNG image named "app_icon.png"
2. Save it to: D:\DEV\Flutter To Do List\cute_todo_app\assets\icon\
3. Run: flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
4. Rebuild the app

**Easiest Way to Create an Icon:**

Use an online tool (no installation needed):
- Go to https://icon.kitchen/
- Choose a simple icon (like a checkmark or heart)
- Select your app colors (Pink #FFB3BA background)
- Download the 1024x1024 version
- Save as "app_icon.png" in the assets/icon folder

**Or use Windows Paint:**
1. Open Paint (built into Windows)
2. Create a new image: 1024 x 1024 pixels
3. Fill background with pink (#FFB3BA)
4. Add a simple shape/text in the center
5. Save as "app_icon.png" in: D:\DEV\Flutter To Do List\cute_todo_app\assets\icon\

**For now, let's use the Flutter default icon** until you create a custom one.
I'll update the configuration to make it optional.
