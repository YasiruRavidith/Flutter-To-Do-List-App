# üîí Security Fix Guide - Remove Exposed Google API Key

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Done:

1. ‚úÖ Added `google-services.json` to `.gitignore`
2. ‚úÖ Removed `google-services.json` from Git tracking
3. ‚úÖ Committed the changes
4. ‚úÖ Removed the file from Git history locally

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NEXT STEPS:

### Step 1: Rotate Your API Keys (DO THIS FIRST!)

**Even after removing from Git, the exposed keys are still compromised!**

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your Firebase project
3. Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**
4. Find the exposed API key and **RESTRICT or DELETE** it
5. Create a new API key with proper restrictions
6. Download new `google-services.json` from [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
7. Replace the file in `android/app/google-services.json` with the new one

### Step 2: Force Push to Remote Repository

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will rewrite history! Notify any collaborators first!**

```powershell
# Navigate to repository
cd "D:\DEV\Flutter To Do List"

# Force push to remote (rewrites history)
git push origin --force --all

# Also force push tags if you have any
git push origin --force --tags
```

### Step 3: Verify on GitHub

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Check the file `android/app/google-services.json` in commit history
3. It should no longer appear in any commit
4. Check Security Alerts - they may take a few hours to clear

### Step 4: Re-clone Repository (For All Team Members)

If you have other computers or team members working on this repo:

```powershell
# Delete old clone
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "old-repo-folder"

# Fresh clone
git clone https://github.com/YasiruRavidith/Flutter-To-Do-List-App.git
```

## üìã Backup Your google-services.json

Keep a secure backup of your `google-services.json`:

**Current Location:** `D:\DEV\Flutter To Do List\cute_todo_app\android\app\google-services.json`

**Backup to:** A secure location OUTSIDE the Git repository, like:
- `D:\DEV\Flutter Secrets\google-services.json`
- Password manager
- Encrypted USB drive

## üîê Future Prevention:

1. ‚úÖ Never commit `google-services.json` again (already in .gitignore)
2. ‚úÖ Use environment variables for API keys in code
3. ‚úÖ Add API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console
4. ‚úÖ Enable branch protection rules on GitHub
5. ‚úÖ Use GitHub's secret scanning alerts

## üìù API Key Restrictions to Add:

In Google Cloud Console, restrict your API key to:

**Application restrictions:**
- Android apps only
- Add your package name: `com.yasiru.cute_todo_app`
- Add your SHA-1 certificate fingerprint

**API restrictions:**
- Cloud Firestore API
- Firebase Authentication API
- Google Sign-In API
- Only enable APIs you're actually using
